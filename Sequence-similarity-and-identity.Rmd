# Sequence alignment
The alignment of biological sequences is probably the most important and most accomplished in the field of bioinformatics. Their utimate goal is to determine the similarity between different sequences.  


# Sequence Similarity and Sequence Identity
For nucleotide sequence (DNA and RNA): Both words have same meaning.  

For protein sequences: both wordds have different meanings  

- Identity: % of exact matches between two aligned sequences.  
- Similarity: % of aligned residuals that share similar characteristics.
