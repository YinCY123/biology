# 1st generation: **Sanger sequencing**.  
1. add single-stranded DNA sequence to four test tubes.  
2. Each tube contain all dNTPs plus one ddNTP.  

# 2nd Generation: Illumina Sequencing Sequencing by Synthesis
1. DNA fragment  
2. add adpator
3. load to the flow cell
4. cluster generation by bridge PCR
5.
